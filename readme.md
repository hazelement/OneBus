# OneBus

About OneBus Feeling tired of bus transfers? When was last time that you got strangled at a transfer stop? Summer is alright, but what about winter? We know it sucks to wait for a bus outside. That's why I came up with OneBus. With OneBus, it shows you destinations with only one bus ride required, no transfers! It works like Google Maps or any other Point of Interest app you know of. Entering places you want to go, OneBus will show you a few destinations around you with a single bus' ride. Wherever you want to go is up to you, but don't forget to give our bus drivers a big smile!
